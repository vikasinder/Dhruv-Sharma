           <p>This is your employee privacy book. It has been designed to make you feel at home in your new work environment.
             This privacy book has all the information needed to make your employment a rewarding experience.  
             A copy of the privacy book will be available in your restaurant and online for you to review as needed. 
              Our philosophy is very simple at McDonald’s, but making it work takes the best effort of everyone on your restaurant’s
               team. Our prime objective is to “Satisfy the Customer.” We accomplish this by giving our best effort everyday in the 
               area of customer service to exceed our guest expectations. Further, we believe that we can “Make a Difference” in the 
               lives of our People, Our Customers, Our Community, & The McDonald’s Brand. We do this a number of ways that you’ll learn more about over time, but one of the most important is to practice the “Golden Rule”, which is to treat others they way that you want to be treated.  This is just the start, as you will continuously learn more ways to impress the customer throughout your entire McDonald’s career. There are three words that best describe how we want our customers to feel about visiting our McDonald’s restaurant - FRIENDLY, EASY, ENJOYABLE!  As you read through this employee privacy book, you will find many reasons for our success. But no single factor is more important than the dedication and effort of our restaurant employees. The McDonald’s spirit is what makes the difference!
