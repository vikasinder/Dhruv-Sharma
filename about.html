            <h2>What you need to know about Macdonals!</h2>

            <p>McDonald's Corporation is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by
                 Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino, California, United States. They rechristened their business as a
                  hamburger stand, and later turned the company into a franchise, with the Golden Arches logo being introduced in 1953 
                  at a location in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and in
                   1961 bought out the McDonald brothers. Previously headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois, it moved to nearby Chicago 
                   in June 2018.[9][10][11][12] McDonald's is also a real estate company through its ownership
                 of around 70% of restaurant buildings and 45% of the underlying land (which it leases to its franchisees)</p>
